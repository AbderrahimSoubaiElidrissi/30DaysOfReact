**description :** Solve the [Elements rendering](https://codepen.io/benrkia/full/wNQadB)

**Thoughts :** learn about react's elements rendering and how react virtual dom works
\
Some resources:

**description :** Solve the [Stateless/function components](https://codepen.io/benrkia/pen/xMQzpW)

**Thoughts :** what is react's stateless/function component, why we need to use react functional components and what is the difference between react's Element & Component.
\
Some resources:
\
[Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

> `DAY 3` : February 17, 2019  
**description :** Continue with Stateless components, in this challenge we shoud create a simple application using complex stateless components (Nested components) & of course use props in order to exchange data between components [Components and Props](https://codepen.io/benrkia/full/ZwVOex)

**Thoughts :** Use stateless/functional components to build complex application by breaking our application down into nested components, it becomes easier to test and easier to keep track of what functionality goes where.
\
Usin props in order to share data between components, props are immutable objects which garantees that each child is responsible of it's state (we can say it's variables) and cannot change his parent's variables.

**description :** Solve the [Circle problem](https://codepen.io/benrkia/full/wNQadB) using react Stateful components and react's Lifecycle.

**Thoughts :** in this challege we recreate the elements renedring problem using react's stateful components and react's lifecycle.

**description :** Solve the [World Clock problem](https://codepen.io/benrkia/full/WPWyyY) using react Stateful Components and Lifecycle Hooks.

**Thoughts :** how to use lifecycle hooks in order to rerender a component each time we change the state.
